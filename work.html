  <strong>HOW WE WORK</strong>
  <br><u>Cool sign is based on the essence, and we set our direction.</u>
  <li>Likelion, there is 'to help those who have a will for growth'.
  <li>Cool signings are people who are concerned about the best educational methods to help people grow.
  <li>Our orientation is based on 'Is it helpful for our students to grow?'
  <li>We think and share how the direction we set is connected to the essence.
  <br><u>Cool signs look in the same direction, based on constant conversation.</U>
  <li>Constant conversation means continuous conversation and information sharing.
  <li>We don't guess the other person's thoughts and check the other person's thoughts directly through continuous conversation. Through this, we frequently check if they are looking in the same direction.
  <li>Information imbalance causes different understanding of the same issue. We share the maximum range of information possible.
  <br><u>Cool sign is based on psychological stability and aims for direct disagreement.</u>
  <li>Psychological stability is mutual trust that "you can speak my opinion extremely honestly to do this job well together."
  <li>A direct disagreement is not a fight, but an exchange of opinions to find a better way.
  <li>Extreme candor allows us to share objections that can lead to important insights without just having them inside. This is why psychological stability is needed for direct disagreement.
  <li>I recognize the possibility that I can be wrong in all the process of sharing opinions.
  <br><u>Fashion signings drive the growth of individuals and companies based on their willingness to grow.</u>
  <li>Like a fashionable lion, a fashionable lion has a strong will to grow further.
  <li>The company's growth is personal growth, and the individual's growth is directed toward a virtuous cycle that leads to the company's growth.
